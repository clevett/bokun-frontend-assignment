# Frontend Assignment

Minimum styling was done per the directions but Tailwind was used and few custom colors added taken from the BÃ³kun website. It was create on a large screen and was not tested or adjusted for small screens Additionally production code would have been tested for accessibility however this was not done for the tech eval as the assignment appeared to be more focused on using the api.

## Setup

1. Create a .env file in the root then add key `NEXT_PUBLIC_API = "{demoAddress}/{assignedId}"`
2. `npm install` in the root folder
3. Run in terminal `npm run dev`

## Notes

Comments and notes have been added to reflect decisions made for the technical eval versus a user facing project.
